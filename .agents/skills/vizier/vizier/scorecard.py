"""Deterministic performance scorecard — does the brain have edge? Measured, not vibed.

Pure functions over the thesis store: no I/O, no network, no clock defaults that
matter. The SKILL fetches the live inputs (current prices for open theses and a
benchmark price history per venue, both from Scout) and passes them in; this module
does the arithmetic the LLM must never do by hand (Rule #2) — per-thesis P&L,
benchmark-relative alpha, hit rate, win/loss profile.

Honesty rules (the same ones the rest of the core follows):
  * a thesis that can't be scored (missing qty/entry price/current price) is SKIPPED
    and NAMED in ``skipped`` — never silently dropped, never guessed;
  * alpha is null when the benchmark series doesn't cover the thesis window, with the
    reason attached — a fabricated benchmark is worse than none;
  * aggregates over an empty set are null, not zero — "no closed theses" is not
    "0% hit rate".

Venue is derived from the canonical symbol form (SKILL.md memory discipline): crypto
is always ``BASE/QUOTE`` (``BTC/USDT``), so a ``/`` in the ticker means crypto and
anything else is ibkr. Returns are simple period returns — no annualization (a 3-day
tactical and a 6-month core annualize into nonsense; ``days_held`` is reported so the
reader can weigh them).
