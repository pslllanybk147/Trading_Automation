Read this before sending any order. The two Valet servers mirror tool **names** but differ in
**capabilities**. Get the venue's quirks right or you mis-size, double-buy, or leave a position
unprotected.

## Units — the one thing you must never get implicit

| Field | Unit |
|---|---|
| `quantity`, `qty`, `position_qty`, `filled_quantity`, thesis `qty`, `qty_sold` | **shares / crypto base units** |
| `cash_amount`, `cash_qty`, `filled_cash`, `value` | **USD** |

**Every exit — protective stop, sell, trim, close — is sized in SHARES, and its ceiling is the quantity
`positions` says you actually hold.** Never size one from an order's fill number: on IBKR a
**cash-quantity (US$) order reports its fill in DOLLARS** (see the IBKR flow, step 3), and a real $2 AAPL
buy would otherwise have produced a 2-share stop against 0.0063 shares held — a naked short. Route every
exit quantity through **`python -m vizier exit-qty`**, which cannot return more than the position.

The Valet returns `{"ok", "data"}` like Scout. **`account_type` (`"LIVE"`/`"PAPER"`) is the assertion
field — it is present and identically named on BOTH venues.** It comes from IBKR's real `isPaper` on the
`ibkr` server and from `CRYPTO_TRADING_MODE` on the `crypto` server — **not** the config label; trust the
account, never the label. The raw boolean differs by venue (`isPaper` on IBKR, `is_paper` on crypto), so
**key off `account_type`, never a venue-specific boolean** (asserting `isPaper` on a crypto response reads
a field that isn't there → silently passes, which is exactly how a "shadow" run leaks into LIVE).

**The venues are asymmetric on how trustworthy `account_type` is.** On IBKR it is **broker-verified** — it
derives from the broker's real `isPaper`, so a mislabel is independently caught. On CRYPTO it only
reflects your own **`CRYPTO_TRADING_MODE`** setting; the exchange does not hand back a paper/live truth, so
`account_type` **cannot independently detect a mislabel** there. Real-money protection on crypto therefore
rests on the **`CRYPTO_ALLOW_LIVE`** gate (and `CRYPTO_DRY_RUN`), **not** on `account_type` — treat the
crypto `account_type` as a self-report, and never let it alone authorize a live order.

---

## Pre-flight (both venues, before EVERY order)

1. `session_status` → assert **`account_type`** (`"PAPER"`/`"LIVE"`) matches the mode you think you're
   in. Mismatch = abort the batch and tell the user. (Re-run this immediately before each order — a
   session can drop between a preview and the buy.)
2. `market_status` → tradeable now? (`crypto` is `ALWAYS_OPEN`; IBKR is RTH-only with NYSE holidays.)
3. `portfolio` / `positions` + `account_summary` → read the **real** book. NAV (`net_liquidation`) is the
   denominator for limits; free cash / `available_funds` is what you can actually deploy this round.
   Buying power ≠ NAV (margin) — never size off buying power.
4. `reconcile` your own recently-sent orders ∪ these positions (assume 30-45s lag) before deciding —
   never double a buy that's already in flight. See **"Building the `reconcile` input"** below — feeding
   it the wrong shape makes it flag every ticker forever (or, worse, trains you to ignore it).

---

## IBKR server (`ibkr`) — 20 tools

`session_status, market_status, get_quote, get_quotes, account_summary, positions, portfolio,
preview_order, buy, sell, close_position, stop_order, trailing_stop, bracket_order, order_status,
wait_for_fill, cancel_order, open_orders, trade_history, reconcile_pending`

**Order flow (mandatory):**
1. `preview_order(symbol, side, ...)` — IBKR `whatif`: estimates commission, margin impact, warnings,
   **without sending**. Read it and reason about cost before committing.
2. `buy(symbol, cash_amount=USD)` → **market-only** (fractional via `cashQty`). For a **LIMIT** you must
   use `buy(symbol, quantity=shares, limit_price=...)` — `cash_amount` cannot be a LIMIT.
   `sell(symbol, quantity, limit_price?)` — **sell is by share quantity only** (no `cashQty`).
   `close_position(symbol)` closes 100% by resolving the exact fractional quantity.
3. After a fill, confirm with `order_status(order_id)` (→ `filled_quantity`, avg price) or
   `wait_for_fill(order_id, timeout_seconds)`.
   > ⚠ **`filled_quantity` on a CASH-QUANTITY (US$) order is NOT a share count you can act on.** IBKR
   > reports that order's cumulative fill **in DOLLARS**: a real live `buy(AAPL, cash_amount=2)` returned
   > `filled_quantity = 2.0` for a position of **0.0063 shares** @ $317.25 (2026-07-13). Valet now
   > normalizes this (`filled_quantity` = shares, `filled_cash` = USD, `is_cash_quantity` = flag), but a
   > **partial** fill of a cash order may still yield no exact share count — Valet returns `None` or marks
   > it an estimate. **Treat it as a cross-check, never as a size.** *(Crypto/CCXT is fine: it reports
   > `filled` in base units already — this is an IBKR-specific hazard.)*
4. **Protective stop is placed AFTER the fill, sized from the POSITION — never from the fill quantity.**
   Read the exact held quantity from **`positions`** (the authority — it returned exactly `0.0063` for the
   fill above), then run **`python -m vizier exit-qty`** with `{"position_qty": <positions>,
   "filled_quantity": <order_status, cross-check>, "filled_cash": …, "is_cash_quantity": …}`. It caps at
   the holding by construction, rounds DOWN to the lot, refuses when no position is resolved, and flags a
   fill that exceeds the position. Send its `qty` to
   `stop_order(symbol, side, quantity, stop_price, limit_price?)` (or `trailing_stop(symbol, side,
   quantity, trail_amount|trail_percent)`). **An exit larger than the holding is a naked short** —
   a 2-share SELL STOP against 0.0063 shares held is not "an oversized stop", it is a short position.
   If `positions` hasn't caught up yet (30-45s lag), **wait and re-read; never fall back to the fill
   quantity.** For a **full** exit prefer `close_position(symbol)` — it resolves the exact fractional
   quantity itself, no float round-trip.
   `bracket_order(symbol, quantity, take_profit, stop_loss, ...)` (OCO) is entry+exits as one, but it is
   sized in SHARES — so it **cannot be the entry for a dollar buy** (the share count only exists after the
   fill). Dollar buy → buy, resolve the position, then attach the stop.
5. `close_position` has a ~45s cooldown + in-flight sentinel. Just after a buy it may report the
   position as not-yet-visible; just after a close, a re-close is refused for ~45s. **Confirm fills via
   `order_status`/`wait_for_fill`, never by re-calling `close_position`** (a naïve retry loop hits the
   guard).

**Stops survive you.** An IBKR `stop_order`/`bracket_order` is a resting order at the broker — it fires
even if this skill is offline.

---

## Crypto server (`crypto`) — 16 tools (the 4 IBKR-only tools are ABSENT)

`session_status, market_status, get_quote, get_quotes, account_summary, portfolio, positions, buy,
sell, close_position, stop_order, cancel_order, open_orders, order_status, trade_history,
reconcile_pending`

**Absent:** `preview_order`, `trailing_stop`, `bracket_order`, `wait_for_fill`.
Consequences you MUST respect:

- **No preview.** Estimate cost with `get_quote`/`get_quotes`. You **cannot** pre-validate the exchange
  **notional/amount minimum** — neither Scout nor the crypto Valet exposes ccxt `market['limits']`, and
  there is no `preview_order`. So for a small dollar buy, **send it and treat a below-minimum rejection
  as an expected, clean "too small" refusal** (report it, drop the leg) — NOT a generic SafetyError
  hard-stop. Do not promise the user a pre-send minimum check; do not hardcode a magic minimum.
- **Spot-only, no short.** A "position" is the base-asset balance; `positions` reads non-zero balances.
  You cannot sell what you don't hold.
- **Buy by value** = market-only (`buy(symbol, cash_amount=)` via `createMarketBuyOrderWithCost`); LIMIT
  needs `quantity`. **Sell by `quantity` only.** A `%`/`$` trim → quantity goes through
  **`python -m vizier trim-qty`** (don't do the division by hand — Rule #2): `{"current_qty": <live base
  balance from `positions`>, "pct": 30}` or `{"current_price": <get_quote>, "dollar_amount": 50,
  "current_qty": <balance>, "step": <market precision>}`. **`current_qty` is REQUIRED in both modes**
  (the tool refuses without it): it is the ceiling that makes an oversell impossible. It rounds **down**
  (never oversells), caps at the held balance, and — pass `"ticker"` + `"tag"` — cross-checks
  `tranche-sell` so a tactical trim can't eat the core. Take the `%` against the **live `positions`
  balance**, not the (possibly stale) thesis `qty`. **After the trim fills, run `python -m vizier
  reduce-thesis-qty --json '{"ticker": "...", "open_date": "...", "qty_sold": <filled BASE qty>}'`**
  (add `"horizon_tag"` when the ticker has several same-day lots) — the tranche guard approves future
  sells against the summed thesis `qty`, so an undecremented thesis is a phantom balance it will happily
  approve against. `close_position(symbol)` sells the **whole** base balance and has a **~30s** cooldown
  (not 45).
- **Fill units here are already correct — do not "fix" them.** CCXT reports an order's `filled` in
  **base units** (BTC, ETH…), including for a `cash_amount` buy. The dollars-as-shares hazard in step 3
  of the IBKR flow above is **IBKR-specific**. The discipline is the same on both venues anyway: **size
  every exit from `positions` via `exit-qty`, never from a fill number** — one rule, no venue special-case
  to forget.
- **No `wait_for_fill`** → confirm fills by **polling `order_status`** until filled/timeout. Never
  re-call `close_position` to "check" (hits the cooldown guard).
- **Protective stop: prefer the EXCHANGE-NATIVE `stop_order` (Valet ≥0.6.0), soft stop as fallback.**
  `stop_order(symbol, side, quantity, stop_price, limit_price?)` places a resting **trigger order on
  the exchange** — it fires even when no agent is running, which is exactly what an unattended position
  needs. Mechanics to respect: most spot APIs (binance included) only offer **stop-LIMIT**, so pass
  `limit_price` (for a SELL stop, at or slightly below `stop_price`) and **disclose the gap risk** ("a
  violent gap can jump the limit and leave the stop unfilled"). **Sized by base `quantity` only — get it
  from `exit-qty` against the live `positions` balance**, same rule as IBKR (a stop bigger than the
  balance can't even rest on a spot exchange; it just fails, or sells the wrong size). The tool
  **refuses cleanly** where the exchange has no native stops — ONLY then fall back to the **SOFT
  skill-monitored stop**, with the old disclosure verbatim: *"protection is skill-managed (monitoring),
  not a resting stop order on the exchange"*, honest about WHEN it fires (in default confirmation mode
  only when Vizier is next invoked, NOT continuously; a real 24/7 soft watch needs armed autonomy plus
  a scheduled loop). Never let "monitoring" imply protection the posture doesn't provide.
- **Crypto-specific pre-mortem:** peg risk if quoting against `USDT`/`USDC` (check `stablecoin_supply`);
  token unlocks / network upgrades / governance / halving as the event-risk analogue to earnings
  blackout; liquidity/slippage — prefer LIMIT with a slippage band off the majors, market only on
  BTC/ETH/liquid majors.

---

## Order-type discipline (both)

- **Default = LIMIT with a max slippage band.** Market only for liquid large-caps/ETFs and BTC/ETH
  majors. A 25%-of-NAV market order into an illiquid name = a bad fill. Read `price_history` (equities) /
  `crypto_order_book` + `crypto_price_history` (crypto) to judge liquidity.
- **Partial / unfilled (LIMIT in illiquids):** `wait_for_fill` with a timeout (IBKR) / poll
  `order_status` (crypto). Filled all → proceed. Partial or nothing at timeout → `cancel_order` the
  rest, **record the thesis against the quantity ACTUALLY filled** (not the target — the
  `baseline_snapshot` and sizing reflect reality), and re-try only if price/conviction still justify.
  Never leave a working order dangling between sessions unjournaled (it becomes a phantom position).
- **After ANY executed partial sell (a trim, either venue): decrement the thesis.** Run
  `python -m vizier reduce-thesis-qty --json '{"ticker": "...", "open_date": "...", "qty_sold":
  <filled qty, in SHARES/base units — never dollars>}'` (plus `"horizon_tag"` to pick the lot when the
  ticker has several on one day) right
  after the fill confirms, and before the session ends. If the remaining qty hits 0, it tells you to
  run `close-thesis` (which records `exit_price`/`realized_pnl`) — it never closes on its own. Skipping
  this leaves the tranche guard approving sells against a quantity you no longer hold.

## Building the `reconcile` input (avoid the double-buy guard's failure mode)

`reconcile` takes `{own_sent_orders, broker_positions, ticker}` and flags `double_buy_risk` when a buy
for `ticker` was sent inside the lag window. Each `own_sent_orders` item needs **`{ticker, side,
value|qty, timestamp, status}`**. The catch: the journaled `executed_orders` schema is only
`{side, ticker, value, venue, order_id}` — **no per-order `timestamp`, no `status`**. If you feed those
rows raw, a missing `timestamp` is treated as "recent forever" and a missing `status` never looks
terminal, so **every ticker you ever bought flags as in-flight forever** (you then either freeze all
re-buys or, worse, learn to ignore the guard and fire into the real lag).

Build the input correctly instead: run **`python -m vizier build-own-sent-orders --json '{"ticker":
"AAA"}'`** — it reads the decision log and emits `own_sent_orders` already shaped for `reconcile`
(per-order `timestamp` falls back to the decision's, `status` to `"filled"` since a journaled order is a
recorded fill). For a still-in-flight order not yet journaled, append a `status` from a fresh
`order_status(order_id)` poll. Best practice: journal each fill with a per-order `timestamp` + `status`
so the log rows are directly reconcile-ready (the day/per-run aggregators ignore the extra fields). Then
call `reconcile` with `"venue"` set so the lag window matches: crypto ~30s, IBKR ~45s (the 45s default is
the conservative side — it over-flags rather than under-flags — so it is safe on both). The Valet's
`DUPLICATE_WINDOW_SECONDS` (default 5s) is a much shorter, independent guard — **do not** lean on it as
your double-buy protection; that rests on `reconcile` + the fill confirmation. (When arming autonomy,
consider setting `DUPLICATE_WINDOW_SECONDS` ≥ the reconcile window.)

## Tool-name corrections (don't mis-call Scout)

- Regime/theme scan uses **`news_search(query)`** (free-text, no symbol). `news_digest(symbols)` and
  `calendar(symbols)` need a symbol list first (e.g. a portfolio scan).
- There is **no** `screen` or `peers`. Generate candidates with `market_movers` / `crypto_movers`,
  `sector_performance` / `crypto_sectors`, `etf_holdings`, `retail_buzz` / `crypto_buzz`, `news_search`,
  `filing_search`. Build dossiers with `company_dossier` / `crypto_dossier`.

## Valet env backstops (set/confirm when arming autonomy — second, independent line)

Shared (in the venue's quote currency): `MAX_ORDER_VALUE` (per-order, default 100), `MAX_DAILY_VALUE`
(cumulative daily BUY cap — empty = **no cap**, so SET it), `DUPLICATE_WINDOW_SECONDS` (reject identical
orders within the window). IBKR live gate: `TRADING_ALLOW_LIVE` (+ `TRADING_DRY_RUN`). Crypto live gate
(independent): `CRYPTO_ALLOW_LIVE` + `CRYPTO_TRADING_MODE=live` + consciously `CRYPTO_DRY_RUN=false`;
spot lock `CRYPTO_ALLOW_MARGIN=false`. **Arming IBKR does NOT arm crypto, and vice-versa.** These Valet
guards are per-order/stateless — portfolio-level and cross-run safety is the skill's `autonomy-gate`.
